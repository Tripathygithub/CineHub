# CineHub
In this project, I built a movie curation app where users can search for movies using the TMDB API, add them to a watchlist, wishlist, or curated lists, and provide reviews and ratings. I implemented features like sorting, searching by genre, actor, or director, and displaying top-rated movies. Everything is publicly accessible
